# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was created using **Create React App**.

## Available Commands

### 1. Start the Development Server
```bash
npm start
Runs the app in development mode.

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view it.

The page automatically reloads when you make changes.

Any linting errors will appear in the console.

2. Run Tests
bash
Copy code
npm test
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

Automatically detects and runs tests.

Useful to check for errors as you develop your app.

3. Build for Production
bash
Copy code
npm run build
Prepares the app for production by optimizing and minifying the code.

The output is placed in a build folder, ready for deployment.

Filenames include hashes for caching purposes.

4. Eject the App
bash
Copy code
npm run eject
⚠️ Warning: This is irreversible. Once ejected, you get full control over configuration files and dependencies like Webpack, Babel, and ESLint.

All other commands will continue to work but now reference the copied configuration files.

Only use this if you need more customization than Create React App provides by default.

✅ This will look clean and professional on GitHub.  

If you want, I can also make a **version with even cleaner spacing and emojis** so it looks super modern for GitHu
